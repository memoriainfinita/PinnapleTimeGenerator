## Special Dedication

This project is lovingly dedicated to **CuriousMarc**, the YouTube channel. I've been watching their videos for years, and they always use these time cards for their YouTube videos. Their content has been a great inspiration.

I would also like to thank Marc and his incredible team of mad scientists for all the amazing content they create and share with the community. *Merci beaucoup* for bringing your French ingenuity and precision to the world of vintage computing and electronics restoration!

## Future Improvements

Plans for future development include:

- **Custom font options**: Allow users to choose between different font styles beyond the default "Some Time Later" font
- **Export formats**: Support for additional export formats beyond PNG (such as JPG, GIF, or video formats)
- **More keyboard shortcuts**: Expand keyboard shortcuts for additional common operations

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- html2canvas (for image export)

## Development Notes

This application was created using **vibe coding** methodology with the assistance of **Claude Sonnet 4.5**. The development process involved iterative improvements and real-time collaboration between human creativity and AI assistance.

The repository includes context files (`claude.md` and `fullstack-mode.md`) that help maintain development context and coding standards across sessions. These files are gitignored as they serve as personal development aids.
