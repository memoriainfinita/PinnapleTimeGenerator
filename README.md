## Special Dedication

This project is lovingly dedicated to **CuriousMarc**, the YouTube channel. I've been watching their videos for years, and they always use these time cards for their YouTube videos. Their content has been a great inspiration.

I would also like to thank Marc and his incredible team of mad scientists for all the amazing content they create and share with the community. *Merci beaucoup* for bringing your French ingenuity and precision to the world of vintage computing and electronics restoration!
