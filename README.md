Pineapple Time Generator is a web application that allows you to easily create time cards in the style of the animated series featuring a yellow sea sponge. This tool is designed to create visually appealing time transitions that you can use in your videos or presentations.

## Features

- **Random phrases**: Generate random phrases in the style of "3 Days Later..." with one click
- **Predefined backgrounds**: Includes a collection of original marine backgrounds from the series
- **Custom backgrounds**: Upload your own backgrounds to customize your time cards
- **Smart color system**: Auto-contrast feature that analyzes background brightness and automatically adjusts text and shadow colors for optimal visibility
- **Customizable style**: Adjust text size (with +/- buttons), text color, and shadow
- **Drag & drop positioning**: Intuitively reposition text by dragging it directly on the screen
- **Safe area margins**: Respects video-safe margins for professional production
- **Two formats**: Switch between 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios
- **Favorites system**: Save and load your favorite preset combinations
- **Easy download**: Save your creations as clean PNG images (no borders, perfect for video editing)

## How to Use

1. Write your text or select a phrase from the dropdown menu
2. Choose a background from the gallery or upload your own
3. Use "Random Colors" to automatically adjust text colors based on background brightness, or customize manually
4. Adjust the style (size with +/- buttons or slider, colors, etc.) according to your preferences
5. Drag the text directly on screen to reposition it, or use the sliders for precise control
6. Change the aspect ratio if necessary (16:9 or 4:3)
7. Save your design as a favorite for quick access later
8. Click "Download" to save your time card as a clean PNG image

## Special Dedication

This project is lovingly dedicated to **CuriousMarc**, the YouTube channel. I've been watching their videos for years, and they always use these time cards for their YouTube videos. Their content has been a great inspiration.

I would also like to thank Marc and his incredible team of mad scientists for all the amazing content they create and share with the community. *Merci beaucoup* for bringing your French ingenuity and precision to the world of vintage computing and electronics restoration!

## Future Improvements

- **Export formats**: Support for additional export formats beyond PNG (such as JPG, GIF, or video formats)
- **Advanced text effects**: Add options for text outlines, gradient text, and other decorative effects
- **More keyboard shortcuts**: Expand keyboard shortcuts for additional common operations
- **Batch processing**: Create multiple time cards at once
- **Templates library**: Pre-made templates for different video styles
